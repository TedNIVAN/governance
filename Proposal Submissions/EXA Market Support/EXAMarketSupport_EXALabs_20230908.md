# Problem Description 
There are currently not enough NFT Marketplaces and P2P asset exchanges on Voi that enable users to buy and sell NFTs and FTs.

# Solution Approach 
We will support and deploy [EXA Market](https://exa.market/) and [EXA Swap](https://swap.exa.market/) on Voi to attract and empower new users.

# Expected Impact & Outcomes for the Voi Community 
Our focus is to bring sustainable and innovative solutions to the Voi ecosystem. We believe that it takes time to build great products and by taking the time to onboard new artists/creators we can get the most out of them.
We believe Voi could be the base layer for specific real world applications and we at EXA Labs think we can help accelerate this vision.

# Technical Approach
Here is how we will proceed:

**1. EXA Swap deployment on Voi**

It allows users to swap assets seamlessly and securely.*

# Define Success
Success will be measured based on the platform activity:
* Number of transactions
* Number of wallets
* Number of monthly active users
* Number of artists/creators
* Revenue generated

# Concerns
We do have some concerns regarding the [ARC-72](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0072) standard as an NFT indexer is needed and not out yet for smart contract based asset standard. This is an unknown variable to us and might impact our development roadmap.


# Project Longevity 
Our team is 100% dedicated to the success of the project. We constantly thrive to find optimal product-market fit and above all being independent of the crypto market condition. Over the past year, we've been involved in multiple events such as NFT NYC, NFT Paris and NFC Lisbon just to name a few to make our brand stand out and attract new customers.


# Project Length
1. Q4 2023 | EXA Swap deployment on Voi Testnet
2. Q2 2024 | EXA Market deployment on Voi Testnet

We do not have information about Voi Mainnet yet. As soon as it is out, both EXA Swap and EXA Market will be deployed.
